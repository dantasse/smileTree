# smileTree
Smile into your webcam, and your computer will draw you a tree.

OpenFrameworks app, mashing together [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) and [ofxProcTree](https://github.com/mrbichel/ofxProcTree), which itself uses [ofxMeshUtils](https://github.com/ofZach/ofxMeshUtils). Thanks to Kyle McDonald, Johan Bichel Lindegaard, Ole Kristensen, and ofZach for creating these.

Run this in xcode, it'll grab your webcam info and show you a little graph of how much it looks like you're smiling. If you smile enough for long enough, it'll draw you another tree. Smile longer and your tree will have more branches. A short smile will only give you a crummy little stick tree.
